#Exercise
==========

For this exercise, I'm providing you an example set of data that is meant to
represent all applicants from the state of Iowa (it is test data).  The data
is provided in the test-data.csv file with the first row describing that particular field.

We would like you read the CSV file, and provide a count of each zip code.

You can use any tools or approaches that you are comfortable with, including:
- Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, vi, ANT, Maven
- loading the data into a database and using SQL
- or something we are not considering.


See the fake-output.csv for an example of the first 5 rows

Please describe the approach you used, and let me know if you have any questions.
