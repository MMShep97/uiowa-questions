#Exercise
==========

For this exercise, I'm providing you an example set of data that is meant to
represent all applicants from the state of Iowa (it is test data).  The data
is provided in the test-data.csv file with the first row describing that particular field.

We would like you to build a java application that can create a pivot table for the CSV file. The application should allow the user to:
1. Load a file from a prompt or command line parameter

1. Specify row and columns (prompt or command line), to pivot on

1. Include Options to show counts

We are not providing all of the information you need to answer the questions, but you should be able to research what you need to complete the exercise.

You can use any tools or approaches that you are comfortable with, including:

- loading the data into a database and using SQL
- loading the data into Excel and using Excel tools
- or something we are not considering.

Please describe the approach you used, and let me know if you have any questions.
